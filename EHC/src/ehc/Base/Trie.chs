%%% Trie, variation which allows matching on subtrees marked as a variable (kind of unification)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This module should -someday- move to a general purpose library.

A Trie is a search structure where the key actually consists of a sequence of keys,
which are iteratively used for searching.
The search structure for common prefixes is shared.

The Trie structure implemented in this module deviates from the usual Trie implementations in
that it allows partial matches besides the normal full match. The objective is to also be able to
retrieve values for which (at insertion time) it has been indicated that part does not need full matching.
This intentionally is similar to unification, where matching on a variable will succeed for arbitrary values.
Unification is not the job of this Trie implementation, but by returning partial matches as well, a list of
possible match candidates is returned.

Partial matching is implemented by administering two deeper nested search trees instead of the usual one.
Normally the default tree is filled when constructing a Trie, the partial tree is filled when the key is flagged
with TKK_Partial. Only at insertion time the proper search structure is setup.

%%% Key into Trie
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A [TrieKey a] is used as a key into a trie, keying into successive mappings.
A TK_One is just a single key.
TK_Partial is a TK_One, but makes looking up also return the corresponding value when partial matched.
TK_Sub gives structure to a [TrieKey a] by partioning corresponding to substructure.
