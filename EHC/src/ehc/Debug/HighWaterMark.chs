{- 
   megaBytesAllocated counts the number of megabytes currently
   allocated by the ghc runtime allocator.

   Note GHC (currently) does not free previously allocated mblocks.
   This means successive calls should never give decreasing values.

   Note from Simon Marlow:

   Note that this only counts memory allocated by the GHC storage manager;
   it doesn't include the data segments, malloc(), the C stack, or other
   mmap()'d stuff.  Be careful if your program is using any of these other
   allocation methods (perhaps via an external library through the FFI).
